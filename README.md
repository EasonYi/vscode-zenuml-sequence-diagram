<h1 align="center"> ZenUML Sequence Diagram</h1>

This project is a fork of [`vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced`](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced), 
which is a popular [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) 
for previewing markdown files.
Most of the code in this fork is inherited from the upstream repository and is thus courtesy of 
[@shd101wyy](https://github.com/shd101wyy) and other [contributors](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced/graphs/contributors) 
to `vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced`.

The fork produces a VSCode extension called `ZenUML Sequence Diagram`, which enables [ZenUML support](https://zenuml.com/) 
in previews.
